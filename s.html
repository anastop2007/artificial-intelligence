      <div class="post">
        <p>During the last 100 years, the world has witnessed a sharp acceleration in technological development thanks to the push of more resources towards research, development and</p>
        <p> knowledge production. Which made technology in its sense cross-geographical; An essential component in measuring the extent of development and progress of societies. But</p>
        <p> this rapid development carries with it at every stage decisive and influential questions in the course of humanity.</p>
        <p>While observing the waves of technological progress; We have seen the great powers insist on developing very advanced applications, such as applying artificial intelligence ( AI )</p>
        <p>, and employing them in the two fields: military and security. We cannot deny that using such technologies peacefully; It is largely reflected in the quality of life of the</p>
        <p>communities that use it.</p>
        <p>The conversation, in political and military circles, often revolves around the exchange of accusations between global powers such as: (the United States and Russia) regarding</p>
        <p> the implementation of global cyber attacks, or regarding the possibility of a specific terrorist group targeting the database of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical</p>
        <p> Weapons; Through advanced technology. In this regard; Iran is not absent from the scene; It is accused of developing a number of electronic attacks on dozens of American</p>
        <p> banks. On the other hand, Tehran accuses the US Department of Defense of launching a cyber attack in an attempt to disrupt its missile launch systems. But I think the next</p>
        <p> level will be more dangerous. Especially if artificial intelligence ( AI ) applications are employed in conflict through cyberspace.</p>
        <p>At a time when politicians are busy discussing all these problems; Scientists are turning their attention to discussing some of the dangers posed by artificial intelligence ( AI )</p>
        <p> to humanity. So that these applications develop themselves; To replace human beings, and to take their place in the medium and long term.</p>
        <p>About three years before the year 2000; For the first time, the world began to link its questions about the end of the world to technology. This is because of the “ Y2K</p>
        <p> Millennium Bug ” dilemma; Which occurred due to a defect in the large computers that control communications and information networks in vital facilities such as: airports,</p>
        <p> hospitals, military bases, and financial institutions. This is because she was unable to read the year 2000, and stop us in the year 1900; The reason for this dilemma: It is that</p>
        <p> the programmers adopted the mechanism of storing year numbers in two digits instead of four; So that the year 1998 is referred to as 98, and the computer can understand it </p>
        <p>so that the next year is 1999. But the year 2000 cannot be understood by the computer as the year following programmatically after the year 99; The world has been able to</p>
        <p> overcome this dilemma through research and development.</p>
        <p>Y2K may not be a big deal; But our understanding of technology at the time was deficient, and of course fear is always accompanied by a lack of knowledge. Once knowledge</p>
        <p> increased and accumulated, The world has put itself before pivotal questions about the challenges that will face us in the future. Which is considered the most dangerous and</p>
        <p> complex; The idea of ​​​​the high pace of technological development and the frantic race towards possessing new technologies, whether by countries or companies; We have come</p>
        <p> to the point of simulating some of the functions of the human mind with extreme accuracy.</p>
        <p>Which leads us to ask: How reasonable is pessimism about the development of artificial intelligence, or does it actually represent a real danger capable of neutralizing or</p>
        <p> eliminating the capabilities and capabilities of the human element.</p>
        <p>Since the STRATEGIECS Think Tank was established ; We have worked to allocate part of our research and material resources to study the effects of steady technological</p>
        <p> development on the behaviors of different societies, and how this dimension affects our lives, their future, and our dealings with their past. Perhaps the most important stage</p>
        <p> in modern technological development, I believe, is when artificial intelligence ( AI ) applications began to contribute to influencing the way users interact with the Internet, and </p>
        <p>the way users interact with each other across the network and on the ground.</p>
        <p>Whereas AI applications can give machines the ability to learn, think, plan and develop, and thus provide options and compare between them; Governments have moved</p>
        <p> towards greater interest in framing and understanding AI applications; To benefit from it to serve its citizens and protect its security. In 2016; The administration of former US</p>
        <p> President Barack Obama issued the National Strategic Plan for Research and Development in Artificial Intelligence, and the current US President, Donald Trump, requested an</p>
        <p> update to it through an executive order issued in February 2019. The focus was on directing long-term investments in artificial intelligence ( AI ) research, developing effective</p>
        <p> methods for cooperation between humans and artificial intelligence, as well as the importance of understanding the ethical, legal, and societal implications of ( AI)  and </p>
        <p>address them, ensuring the safety and security of these systems, and focusing on the importance of understanding the needs of the national workforce; Regarding artificial</p>
        <p> intelligence research and development.</p>
        <p>The importance of these fields stems from their focus on researching the impact of artificial intelligence without leaving room for speculation. Algorithms, which are a series of</p>
        <p> instructions used to solve problems in technology applications, represent the basic building blocks of the advanced digital world we see today. Which was developed by</p>
        <p> programmers to teach computers new tasks without consulting the developers; Precisely on this basis, many scientists fear that humans will lose control over the machine.</p>
        <p>We refer here to Facebook’s interactive chatbot experience at the end of 2017. These robots had to use English to negotiate with each other; With the aim of exchanging balls,</p>
        <p> books and hats; These robots were able to negotiate and communicate; But the worrying thing is that it combined English words in a way that no one understood, and</p>
        <p> Facebook discovered that robots had come up with a language of their own. Which led to stopping the experiment; Fear of robots accessing databases without Facebook's</p>
        <p> knowledge; So it is really important that these hypotheses are studied very carefully; But on the other hand, the importance of the development that the world has reached</p>
        <p> thanks to AI applications should not be underestimated .</p>
        <p>There is another hypothesis that is more present than the elimination of humanity regarding the effects of AI on humans. It is related to the social aspect; Where it is</p>
        <p> necessarily assumed that the machine will replace humans in some basic functions. Such as medical professions, driving, working in factories, etc.; The American author and</p>
        <p> author of the book “The Rise of the Robot,” Martin Ford, believes that machines will cause people to lose many of their jobs, and that they will greatly increase the</p>
        <p> unemployment rate. But I think there is a possibility that this proposition is not entirely accurate.We can discuss the inaccuracy of this proposition from two main perspectives:</p> 
            <p>The first: We fully believe in the validity of replacing machines with humans in some traditional jobs. But this does not mean that the professions that the machine will perform</p>
            <p> will keep people unemployed or stuck on the beach. In fact, technological development has created a large number of jobs that humans have never practiced before, all of</p>
            <p> which are related to the development of technological applications, programming, computer science, and digital security. This is at the current level; As for the future level;</p>
            <p> People will not stop finding alternative and renewable jobs. Thus, attractive investment opportunities in the world will multiply.As for the second perspective: it is that the</p>     
             <p>nature of the jobs in which the machine has proven its superiority is related to accuracy, logical calculations, and multiple tasks. In which human error may lead to loss of life</p>
             <p> or exacerbation of problems; The ChatBot website, for example, worked to find a solution to diagnostic problems in psychiatry. Due to the inability of individuals in some</p>
             <p> societies to bear the high costs of diagnosis; This is through developing a natural language in which software speaks to human users. So that this software can act as a virtual</p>
             <p> therapist and provide guidance and support to those who do not have effective alternatives. In addition, the results of monitoring these applications, which use (AI ) for</p>
             <p> psychological treatment, showed that they were effective with patients who felt more free to talk about their illnesses. This certainly does not mean human inaccuracy;</p>     
           <p> However, in particularly rigid professions that do not require creativity, human cooperation with machines will be useful in reducing errors. Likewise, many large companies</p>
           <p> rely on ready-made templates more than on the creativity of their employees. Specifically if these jobs are related to design, arts, and creative thinking; Individuals working</p>
           <p> there may feel that the true purpose of their presence in these places is missing. Because their job titles require them to unleash their own creativity, but these companies do</p>
           <p> not have much time to experience this creativity; What constitutes a real dilemma for many of these individuals, and inspires them to search for places where they can employ</p>
           <p> their special abilities. Therefore, artificial intelligence will be a good alternative to using ready-made templates for them.After all the above; The most important question</p>       
            <p> arises about the possibility of applying complex artificial intelligence systems to the same extent across the world. Where: Russia, China, Japan, Germany and France can</p>
            <p> develop their strategies to deal with AI applications research . But what about countries that need to develop digital infrastructure, and whose governments already suffer from</p>
            <p> data poverty? This data is the core on which artificial intelligence is developed; Meaning that specific countries can deal with this development, for example; If we assume that </p>
            <p>Uber, through its acquisition of “ Mighty AI“Specialized in developing artificial intelligence applications related to driving, it has developed a special program for self-driving car</p>
            <p> technologies, and wants to replace its human fleet in the world with self-driving cars. If this program is successful in developed countries, will it be able to apply this system in</p>
            <p> developing countries that lack An efficient Internet network, in which the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) usually faces a defect due to the lack of continuous updating of road</p>
            <p> data?! And many areas may not be covered by a communications network at all, which means that in the simplest hypotheses, these systems may suffer from challenges. There</p>
            <p> are major obstacles to sweeping the world, and therefore talking about the machine neutralizing the human element in the world will not be accurate. Based on the above;</p>
         <p>There is almost agreement that the world is still and will continue to live the stage of experimentation in search of certainty and truth. Producing its own mistakes and </p>
         <p>judgments that will have an impact on the lives of societies. But research, development and diligent study; They will inevitably underestimate the size of the error in the </p>
         <p>journey of searching for the best; As we move forward on this journey, we must not forget the societies that suffer from lag in   development, health services, and education.</p>
